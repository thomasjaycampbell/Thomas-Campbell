				<p> Hello! First of all, a little about me. I'm a honorary native of the Triangle area. I grew up in Cary, went to NC State, and currently live in Wake Forest with my wife and two cats. When Iâ€™m not coding or working in web development, I spend most of my time running, reading, cooking, and playing the occasional video game. 

	
				<p> Running has become a recent passion for me. It has quickly become my favorite way to disconnect, but also to challenge myself. Keeping my mind and body fit has become an important part of my life and setting and exceeding PRs is invigorating. Eating well ties into this as well, and cooking daily at home with my partner Lindsey is a great way to stay healthy and spend time together. 

				<p> All the activities that interest me involve hard work and passion. They push me out of my comfort zone to achieve my goals, and have taught me to not be afraid of falling short at times. Whether its burnt chicken or a bout with runners knee, set backs are inevitable. Learning from these experiences and growing is key.
